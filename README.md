# Pi-rover-robot

Repository for main code, libraries, hardware testing and simulator for a Raspberry Pi based rover robot.

Can I create an autonomous rover robot that can navigate around the garden, tracking it's location with BLE beacons, using a camera and image analysis to detect the lawn edge and other sensors to find and avoid other obsticles around the garden? Originally conceived with the intention of making an automated lawn mower (which may still happen) but the build and automation challenges are far more interesting first.

Blog posts detailing hardware build and software development pending.
